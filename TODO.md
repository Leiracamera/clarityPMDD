To-Do List for Next Steps
User Session Management

Display the logged-in status (e.g., "Logged in as [username]") on the page.
Add "Log In" and "Log Out" buttons, and conditionally show them based on session status.
Ensure the user can see they are logged in upon login and logged out upon logout.
Data Visibility

Verify that logged-in users can only see their own entries.
Ensure that when logged out, users cannot access or view any personal data.
Test that data associated with each user is correctly displayed after login.
Database and Session Integrity

Confirm that user sessions are securely stored and managed.
Test database queries to ensure they correctly filter data by user_id.
User Feedback

Provide messages for successful login, logout, and entry creation.
Add error handling to notify users if login fails or if any restricted action is attempted when not logged in.
UI Enhancements

Consider adding a navbar or persistent header/footer for better navigation.
Optionally, create a "Profile" or "Dashboard" page where users can manage their information and view entries.
Logout Functionality

Implement a POST /logout route to handle session termination.
Redirect the user to the homepage or login page after logging out.
Test and Debug

Test the full user experience: login, view entries, create entries, log out.
Check for any edge cases where unauthorized data might be accessible.
This list should give you a clear roadmap for when you pick up the project again. Let me know if thereâ€™s anything more specific to add!
